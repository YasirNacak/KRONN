# KRONN
Summer homework

# Project Description

KRONN is a space shooter game created using Allegro 5.0.10 libraries for C.

It has a scenario mode (unfinished) and an endless mode. It also comes with a launcher which helps you choose audio level, resolution and language. You can simply copy another language file, translate it to your language and modify Lanugages.txt file to make a patch to the game for your language.

There are also unit templates in .krm and .krac folders. You can modify them or add your own units to the game. Their file format is rather simple so just copying another unit and making changes lets you create new additions. All scenarios are also in .krscn files but in order to edit them, you need to modify language files for safety. If you are not planning to use launcher, you can modify .krscn files too.

All the code, sprites, music and sfx are made from scratch by me. I used to have music from other creators but because of copyright issues, I created new music for the game even though their file names are the same as before because of the code.

# Compiling and running

To compile the code and get it running, you need to have Allegro 5.0.10. There are a bunch of tutorials online for getting Allegro running so I am not gonna get too descriptive here. One thing you should do is, have the allegro-5.0.10-monolith-mt.dll, Kronnatorium.exe(executable you get out of the code), KronnLauncher and data folder in the same directory. And if you are gonna use the launcher, you also need to put Lanugages.txt and kronn_text_??.krlang files in that directory too.
